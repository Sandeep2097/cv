 <br>
## Abstract:- 
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language that's used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them. Initially created in the 1970s, SQL is regularly used not only by database administrators, but also by developers writing data integration scripts and data analysts looking to set up and run analytical queries. The uses of SQL include modifying database table and index structures; adding, updating and deleting rows of data; and retrieving subsets of information from within a database for transaction processing and analytics applications. Queries and other SQL operations take the form of commands written as statements -- commonly used SQL statements include select, add, insert, update, delete, create, alter and truncate. SQL became the de facto standard programming language for relational databases after they emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Also known as SQL databases, relational systems comprise a set of tables containing data in rows and columns. Each column in a table corresponds to a category of data -- for example, customer name or address -- while each row contains a data value for the intersecting column.

 ## Introduction:-
 SQL commands are divided into several different types, among them data manipulation language (DML) and data definition language (DDL) statements, transaction controls and security measures. The DML vocabulary is used to retrieve and manipulate data, while DDL statements are for defining and modifying database structures. The transaction controls help manage transaction processing, ensuring that transactions are either completed or rolled back if errors or problems occur. The security statements are used to control database access as well as to create user roles and permissions. 
SQL syntax is the coding format used in writing statements. [Figure 1](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/editorial/sSQLServer_Figure1_082516_desktop.png) shows an example of a DDL statement written in Microsoft's T-SQL to modify a database table in SQL Server 2016:
 
 ## Commands
 ## Alter Table
 *lets you add columns to a table in a database.*
 > ALTER TABLE table_name 
 > ADD column_name datatype;
 
 ## AND
 *AND is an operator that combines two conditions. Both conditions must be true for the row to be included in the result set.*
 > SELECT column_name(s)
 > FROM table_name
 > WHERE column_1 = value_1
 > AND column_2 = value_2;

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
